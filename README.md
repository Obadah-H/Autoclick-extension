#  [Autoclick-extension](https://github.com/Obadah-H/Autoclick-extension) 

This is a very simple extension to automate the process of getting free ether. as https://teth.bitaps.com/ allows to request one ether per minute, this extension can be used to request one each minute / interval. It shows the last request time as button label to track clicks. Despite that it's an extremely simple extension, I'm uploading it here as it might be helpful for others.

To use this extension, from the extensions -> enable developers mode , then import the folder containing this extension
